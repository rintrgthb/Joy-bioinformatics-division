So, you want to assemble and annotate the bacterial genome. Where to start?

At first you have to download the data from public database - I will download data in SRA format from NCBI library.

Find data as an archive in .sra format. Download the sequencing data for this sample. The data you receive from NCBI has an unusual format called sra. 
SRA = Sequence Read Archive
